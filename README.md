# Mongodb quickstart course

Placeholder for Talk Python's **free** MongoDB course. Will include demos and handout material for the course. 

Please create an account or join the mailing list at [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/) to get notified when the course is available. We are aiming for the end of September / early October.

Wondering how this compares to our full, commercial [MongoDB for Python for Developers course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_mongodb_for_python_developers_course/mongodb-for-python-for-developers-featuring-orm-odm-mongoengine)? This course is a brief introduction and will be about 1.25 hours. The full MongoDB course covers much more, in greater depth and is 7 hours of content.
