# Mongodb quickstart course

Placeholder for Talk Python's free MongoDB course. Will include demos and handout material for the course. 

Please create an account or join the mailing list at [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/) to get notified when the course is available. We are aiming for the end of September / early October.
